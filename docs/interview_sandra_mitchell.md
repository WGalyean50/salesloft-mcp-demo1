## Interview Transcript

**Marcus:** Sandra, thanks so much for taking the time. I know you're busy, and we've got a packed calendar for this week, so I really appreciate you carving out 30 minutes. Before we jump in, I'm curious—from your perspective as CRO, what's keeping you up at night when you think about selling into the Am Law 200 right now?

**Sandra:** *laughs* Where do I even start? Look, we've been in this space for eight years, and the last three years have been a completely different animal. The buying process is so much more complex now. It used to be a partner or two would champion your product, you'd do a couple demos, and you'd close. Now you've got procurement, you've got legal departments getting involved, compliance teams, IT security. The approval chain is brutal—I'm talking 6 to 9 months for some of these deals.

**Marcus:** Nine months. That's a serious drag on your sales cycle.

**Sandra:** Exactly. And that's assuming you even get past the first gatekeepers. The hardest part isn't the product fit anymore—it's getting buy-in internally at these firms. The partners, especially the equity partners, they see any change as friction. They're making partner economics decisions based on billable hours, right? So when we come in with a tool that's supposed to improve efficiency, there's this underlying resistance because efficiency could theoretically cut into billable hours.

**Marcus:** That's the paradox I keep hearing about. Talk me through that more, because I want to understand the psychology there.

**Sandra:** So, a partner at a top firm might bill 2,000 hours a year. They're making $5 million on partner distributions. Their economics are tied directly to hours billed, not to how efficiently those hours are spent. If you come in with a tool that says "we'll help you bill better," they hear "we'll help you bill fewer hours." Even if that's not true, even if the tool actually helps them land bigger clients and take on more work, the initial resistance is defensive.

**Marcus:** So it's not just change resistance—it's economic misalignment.

**Sandra:** Exactly. It's structural to their business model. And look, I get it. The legal industry is fundamentally different from other service businesses. Alternative fee arrangements are growing—some of our best-selling modules are around matter economics and fixed-fee engagements—but most of these firms still live and die by the billable hour.

**Marcus:** When you think about getting deals unstuck, how are you currently trying to overcome that?

**Sandra:** We've learned to focus on executive sponsorship. We don't win unless there's a managing partner, usually the COO or CFO equivalent, who has a stake in the outcome. That person understands firm economics from a different angle. They care about profitability, margins, client retention—not just billable hours. They're the ones who get that efficiency can mean better service delivery, faster turnarounds, happier clients, better retention.

**Marcus:** So the COO is your true champion.

**Sandra:** Or the COO and the practice group leader. We actually built in an approach where we target co-sponsorship. It's not just one person anymore. We need the operational leader and the practice leader aligned. But even with that, the second part of the battle is change management.

**Marcus:** What does that look like? I imagine law firm partners aren't the easiest group to get to adopt new software.

**Sandra:** *sighs* You have no idea. We spend a lot of time on training—almost more than we should probably need to. But law firm partners are independent operators, right? They've built their own books of business. They don't see themselves as part of a system. Getting them to use new tools consistently, especially if it requires daily behavior change, is a nightmare. We've had implementations where the software is perfect, but the adoption never gets past 40% because partners won't use it.

**Marcus:** How do you address that?

**Sandra:** Quick wins. Seriously, that's the secret. You need to show them value in week two or three, not month four. We've restructured our onboarding to focus on immediate payoff. For example, instead of rolling out our full platform, we roll out lead scoring and opportunity prioritization first. Partners see it, they use it, they get better information on their pipeline. Boom. Now they're invested.

**Marcus:** So it's less "here's the system" and more "here's how this helps you tomorrow."

**Sandra:** Right. And it has to be culturally appropriate to how they work. Law firm partners don't respond to company-wide mandates. They respond to peer influence and personal gain. So we make the win personal. We might say, "This partner at another firm in your network is using this to increase realization rates by 15%." That gets their attention.

**Marcus:** Realization rates—that's the gap between standard rates and what they actually bill?

**Sandra:** Exactly. It's one of the few metrics that actually aligns with their economic model. If you can show them that better deal tracking and work allocation increases realization rates, you're speaking their language. You're not asking them to change behavior for some abstract operational goal—you're asking them to change behavior because it makes them more money.

**Marcus:** That's smart. Let's shift a bit to the procurement side. You mentioned that's become a major friction point. Walk me through what a typical deal looks like now from a procurement perspective.

**Sandra:** So, this is the thing that's changed the most. Five years ago, procurement didn't even exist in these conversations. Now, every firm with more than $100 million in revenue has a formal procurement process. They're bringing in consultants, they're standardizing vendor management, they're treating technology purchases like corporate enterprises do.

**Marcus:** What's the procurement team looking for? Are they looking at cost, or are they looking at risk?

**Sandra:** Both, but risk is increasingly the bigger factor. Cost is almost secondary. They want to understand: What data are you handling? How are you storing it? Who has access to it? What happens if you have a security breach? What happens if your company goes under? These are real questions because they're legally liable for client data.

**Marcus:** So this is where legal and compliance get involved?

**Sandra:** Yes, and this is where it gets complicated. You've got procurement, you've got the information security team, you've got the legal department. They all have veto power. And they're not always aligned. Procurement cares about price and terms. Legal cares about liability and confidentiality. IT cares about security and integration. Getting all three to agree is like herding cats.

**Marcus:** What's your playbook for managing that complexity?

**Sandra:** We've built a vendor management kit. It includes SOC 2 certification, compliance documentation, contract templates that address their standard concerns. We have a security questionnaire that we fill out proactively. But honestly, the real unlock is having a legal operations person at the prospect firm who understands both tech and their firm's needs. If we can get that person—they're usually at the director or VP level—involved early, they become an internal advocate.

**Marcus:** They understand your language.

**Sandra:** Exactly. They've dealt with other tech vendors. They know that security questionnaires are standard, that SOC 2 compliance is table stakes. They can educate their own stakeholders. They can translate what you're saying into terms that procurement understands and that IT understands.

**Marcus:** Let's dig into the security angle specifically, because I imagine for law firms, confidentiality and data security are existential concerns.

**Sandra:** They are. And rightfully so. Law firms hold the most sensitive information about their clients—IP, litigation strategy, financials, personal information. If that information gets breached, the firm's entire reputation is at risk. Clients can leave. The firm can face liability. So when we talk to them about our platform, security is not a nice-to-have. It's the foundation of the conversation.

**Marcus:** What are the standard certifications and compliance requirements?

**Sandra:** SOC 2 Type II is baseline. It's not negotiable. We also need GDPR compliance, often CCPA compliance depending on where the firm operates. For some of our government-adjacent clients, we need FedRAMP. Many firms are asking about our encryption standards, how we handle data at rest and in transit, what our incident response protocols are.

**Marcus:** That's a significant list.

**Sandra:** It is. And here's the thing—we have all of it. But proving it is almost as much work as building it. We spend enormous resources on security documentation, on passing audits, on maintaining compliance. We have a head of security who spends most of their time answering questionnaires and maintaining documentation.

**Marcus:** Do you feel like you've got the right leverage in those conversations, or do you feel like you're constantly on the back foot?

**Sandra:** We're on the back foot, honestly. The large firms have more than one vendor they're evaluating. They can pit vendors against each other on compliance and security. Some of our competitors have older certifications or less comprehensive security, so they can afford to be aggressive on price or terms. We can't. We've built our differentiation on security and compliance being best-in-class.

**Marcus:** So it's a competitive advantage, but also a constraint.

**Sandra:** Right. We can't race to the bottom on price like some vendors do. We have to maintain that investment. That said, it does filter out a lot of tire-kickers. The firms that are serious about security and compliance come to us and stick with us.

**Marcus:** Let me ask about something I keep hearing in the market—corporate legal. We see a lot of conversations about corporate legal buying motion being different from law firm buying.

**Sandra:** *perks up* Yes. This is actually a huge secondary market opportunity for us that we're still figuring out. Corporate legal departments are a different buyer profile entirely. They're typically not trying to increase efficiency or profitability—they're trying to manage cost, manage risk, and demonstrate value to the CFO.

**Marcus:** So the value prop is different?

**Sandra:** Completely different. A law firm partner cares about realization rates and book of business. A general counsel cares about law spend management and legal operations. They want to understand: Are we paying market rates to our outside counsel? Are we getting good service? Can we consolidate vendors? Are we creating unnecessary legal work because our business teams don't know the policies?

**Marcus:** And they're buying on behalf of the firm?

**Sandra:** Usually they're buying tools that help them manage relationships with law firms and service providers. So they're not a direct competitor to law firm solutions, but they're adjacent. And what's interesting is that corporate legal is actually more innovative than law firms in some ways. They're adopting new technologies faster, they're not beholden to the billable hour model, they're thinking about efficiency and cost management.

**Marcus:** Are you seeing them want to work together? Like, could corporate legal departments and law firms co-sell or co-adopt?

**Sandra:** That's the dream, right? And occasionally it happens. We have some deals where a corporate legal department will use our software to work with their outside counsel, and some firms get involved through that channel. But mostly they're separate buying motions. Corporate legal is an opportunity because they have money to spend and they need solutions, but they're a different conversation entirely.

**Marcus:** Let me come back to something you said earlier about alternative fee arrangements. You mentioned that as a growth area. How much of your revenue is coming from that versus traditional billable hour models?

**Sandra:** About 35% of our revenue comes from firms or practice groups using some form of alternative fee arrangement. That's up from 15% three years ago. The growth is real. But here's the challenge—alternative fee arrangements actually create different pain points. If you're on a fixed fee, you need visibility into cost, time, resource allocation. You need to know if you're making money on a deal or losing money.

**Marcus:** So the tool becomes essential to the economics.

**Sandra:** Exactly. But that also means the buyer is usually more sophisticated. They've already made a strategic decision to move away from the billable hour. They're not going to sit around debating the philosophy. They're going to buy a solution that helps them manage fixed-fee work.

**Marcus:** That sounds like a more efficient sale.

**Sandra:** It is. The buying committee is smaller, the decision happens faster, and there's less philosophical resistance. But it's a smaller pool of firms. The partners at Am Law 10 firms on alternative fee arrangements? That's maybe 40 or 50 firms total. The partners at mid-market firms just starting to experiment? That's a bigger pool, but they're also less sophisticated buyers and they're smaller deals.

**Marcus:** So there's quality versus volume there.

**Sandra:** Right. We've actually started segmenting our strategy. For the big, sophisticated firms on alternative fee arrangements, we go enterprise. We do deep deals, long sales cycles, but big contracts. For mid-market firms experimenting with alternative fees, we've built lighter versions of the product at lower price points. For the traditional billable hour firms—and that's still the vast majority of the market—we've had to build special value propositions around realization rates and partner economics.

**Marcus:** Let's talk about that realization rate value prop more. How do you actually help firms increase realization rates?

**Sandra:** There are a few levers. First, better visibility into what work is being done and how long it's taking. Partners often have vague time entries. They'll log "client meeting" for three hours when it was really one client call and two hours of follow-up work on another client. Better time tracking helps them bill more accurately.

**Marcus:** They're leaving money on the table through sloppy time tracking?

**Sandra:** Constantly. Some studies suggest realization rates across the industry are 75-80%, meaning firms are leaving 20-25% on the table. Part of that is write-downs for junior lawyers who are slow. Part of it is poor time tracking. Part of it is negotiations with clients who push back on bills. Our tools help on all three fronts.

**Marcus:** What about the junior lawyer angle? Can you actually improve efficiency there?

**Sandra:** That's actually the most sensitive part of the conversation. If you tell a partner, "Our tool will help your junior lawyers work faster," they hear, "You can hire fewer junior lawyers." Junior associates are profit centers for law firms. They bill a lot of hours at lower rates, and the partner takes the margin.

**Marcus:** So efficiency actually creates a dilemma.

**Sandra:** It does. The partner might become more efficient, which is good. But junior lawyers who were doing six hours of work in eight hours might now do it in six. The firm's internal efficiency goes up, but the billable hour output is the same. It doesn't create more revenue unless it frees up capacity to take on new clients.

**Marcus:** Which brings you back to the firm economics question.

**Sandra:** Exactly. And this is where the conversation has to shift to something bigger. It's not about making individual lawyers more efficient. It's about using that freed-up capacity to bring in better clients, do higher-value work, shift to alternative fee arrangements. But that requires a strategic conversation that most partners aren't ready to have.

**Marcus:** So you're selling tools to organizations that haven't decided what they want to do with the capacity they'll create.

**Sandra:** *laughs* That's a really accurate way to put it. And that's why executive sponsorship matters so much. The managing partner, the COO, they have to be the ones saying, "Here's what we're going to do with this capacity. Here's the strategic direction." Without that, you're just making the firm more efficient at something they're not sure they want to be doing.

**Marcus:** Let me ask you about your go-to-market approach. How are you currently structuring the sales process to account for all this complexity?

**Sandra:** We've really changed our approach in the last two years. We used to have a pretty traditional sales organization—account executives, sales development reps, the whole model. It worked okay, but we were losing deals in the procurement and implementation phases. Now, we've embedded sales engineering and implementation earlier. We have sales engineers who specialize in law firms. They understand the technical requirements, but they also understand the legal tech landscape.

**Marcus:** So you're not just selling software, you're consulting on how they should think about this.

**Sandra:** We're selling expertise. We're saying, "Here's what firms like yours are doing. Here's what's working. Here's what isn't. Let's figure out what makes sense for you." It's more consultative.

**Marcus:** And that extends to change management, I'm guessing?

**Sandra:** It has to. We've learned the hard way that implementation without change management is a waste of time. We actually have dedicated change management resources who work with the firm on adoption strategy, training, measuring early wins. The software can be perfect, but if nobody uses it, it's worthless.

**Marcus:** What does that resource look like?

**Sandra:** We've got change managers on staff. They're not developers or salespeople. They're specialists in organizational change, specifically in law firm contexts. They work with the sponsor at the firm, usually the managing partner or COO, to build an adoption strategy. What's the timeline? Who needs to be trained? How do we measure success? What are the early wins we're going to showcase?

**Marcus:** And you're doing this from the sales side, not just from implementation?

**Sandra:** We're doing it from sales onward. The change manager gets involved during the sales process, sometimes even during discovery. They're helping shape the proposal, the contract terms, the timeline. Because if we promise a three-month implementation when we know it's going to take eight months with proper change management, we've already lost.

**Marcus:** That's really different from how a lot of software companies operate.

**Sandra:** It has to be different. We're selling to industries that don't adopt software quickly. We have to build that into our model.

**Marcus:** Let's zoom out for a second. If I'm Salesloft and Clari, and we're thinking about what we can do to help you and other legal tech companies win in this market, what are the biggest gaps you see?

**Sandra:** *pauses* That's a great question. Honestly, I think the biggest gap is visibility into the buying process at these firms. The deals are longer, the committees are bigger, the stakeholders are more distributed. We have a rough timeline, but we don't actually know what's happening in that procurement committee. We don't know if legal is happy. We don't know if the IT security person is going to be a blocker.

**Marcus:** So you're flying blind in some sense.

**Sandra:** We are. We talk to our sponsor, and they give us updates, but they don't always know what's happening in closed-door meetings. A tool that gave us better visibility into the buying committee—who's involved, what their concerns are, what they're saying about us—that would be incredibly valuable.

**Marcus:** How would that work? Would that be insights from the firm?

**Sandra:** Ideally, yeah. It could be as simple as getting better intel from your sponsor about who's in the meetings, what questions are being asked, what objections are coming up. Today we find out about blockers after we've already lost the deal. If we knew earlier, we could adjust our approach, involve technical expertise, address concerns directly.

**Marcus:** So it's essentially sales intelligence during the deal cycle.

**Sandra:** Exactly. And then the second thing is benchmarking. I'd love to know how our deal looks compared to our competitors. How long does our average deal take? How does that compare to other legal tech vendors? What are the sticking points? What are the standard contract terms for this industry?

**Marcus:** You don't have that benchmark data?

**Sandra:** We do internally, but it's all historical. It's not standardized across the industry. And frankly, we don't know if our long sales cycles are normal or if we're doing something inefficiently. Are our competitors taking just as long? Are they shorter? What's the market doing?

**Marcus:** That's actually a really interesting gap.

**Sandra:** It is. And then the third thing is post-sale. Once we close a deal, our visibility into the implementation, adoption, and value realization drops significantly. We have some data from our product, but we don't have great information about whether the customer is actually achieving the value they expected. Are they adopting the software? Are realization rates going up? Is the sponsor happy? Are they going to renew?

**Marcus:** That's a leading indicator of churn.

**Sandra:** Completely. If we knew early that a customer wasn't seeing value, we could intervene. We could bring in additional resources, re-engage the sponsor, adjust the strategy. Instead, we sometimes find out about churn when they don't renew.

**Marcus:** Those are all really compelling use cases.

**Sandra:** They are. And I think for a company like Salesloft or Clari, you have an interesting position. You understand sales processes and buying committees. You have visibility into communication and intelligence tools. If you could adapt that for the legal tech space, specifically around law firm buying and changing complex buying committees, that could be valuable.

**Marcus:** That's helpful. Let's talk about timing. How are you thinking about your go-to-market strategy for 2026?

**Sandra:** We're doubling down on the strategy I mentioned—more consultative selling, earlier involvement of technical and change management resources, focus on executive sponsorship and co-sponsorship. We're also trying to build more of a community and peer influence strategy. We're hosting summits for legal ops leaders and practice group leaders, getting them to share what's working at their firms.

**Marcus:** Creating advocacy?

**Sandra:** Exactly. If a managing partner at a peer firm says, "This is what we did and here's the impact," that's worth more than anything our sales team can say. We're investing in that because we think it'll shorten sales cycles and reduce the philosophical objections.

**Marcus:** How are you thinking about different firm sizes? Is your strategy different for Am Law 10 versus Am Law 100 versus mid-market firms?

**Sandra:** It's pretty different, honestly. Am Law 10 firms are sophisticated buyers, but they're also very risk-averse. They're not going to adopt something unless it's been proven elsewhere in the Am Law 10. They have huge procurement and security requirements. Sales cycles are long, but once you're in, you're in.

**Marcus:** Because they're your reference customer.

**Sandra:** Right. If you're in an Am Law 10 firm, every firm below you in the rankings wants to know that. It's social proof at scale. Am Law 100 firms are more of a middle ground. They have procurement processes, but they're not quite as rigorous. They're hungrier for innovation, which can be good and bad. Sales cycles are shorter, but they're also more likely to churn if they don't see value quickly.

**Marcus:** And mid-market?

**Sandra:** Mid-market is where we're seeing the fastest growth. They're way ahead of Am Law 200 in terms of alternative fee arrangements and operations. They're adopting technology faster. They're more willing to experiment. The challenge is they have less money to spend. We have to be smarter about packaging. But the good news is we don't spend as much time on procurement and security battles because they're less risk-averse.

**Marcus:** So your growth is actually coming from outside the traditional Am Law 200 hierarchy?

**Sandra:** Some of it, yes. The Am Law 200 is a meaningful part of our strategy, but it's not the only strategy. We're also selling to 200-400 size firms, to European law firms, to specialized practice firms. The playbook is similar, but the buyers are different.

**Marcus:** That makes sense. Last question for me: If you had to pick one thing that would change the game for you in your sales process, what would it be?

**Sandra:** *thinks for a moment* Honestly, it would be reducing the time it takes to close deals without reducing the depth of the conversations. Right now, the longer sales cycle is partly because we're doing the right things—getting executive sponsorship, doing change management planning, addressing security and compliance concerns. But I think there's still a lot of friction in the process.

**Marcus:** Where's the biggest friction?

**Sandra:** The middle phase. You've had your initial conversations, the sponsor is engaged, the prospect is interested. Now you're in this long middle phase where you're answering questionnaires, having security meetings, going through procurement. It takes months. If we could compress that phase without cutting corners, we'd win more deals and win them faster.

**Marcus:** Is it the process at the prospect end, or is it on your end?

**Sandra:** Mostly the prospect end. But partly it's on us. Sometimes we're not efficient at responding. Sometimes we have to loop in more resources than we should need to. But mostly, the prospect's procurement and security process is just slow. There are only so many people doing those reviews at any given firm, and they're handling deals across all categories, not just software.

**Marcus:** So bottleneck is on their end.

**Sandra:** It is. And I'm not sure there's a silver bullet. But if there were a way to—I don't know—proactively address the standard security and procurement questions, get ahead of the normal objections, have better dialogue with the actual procurement person instead of our sponsor being the intermediary—that could help.

**Marcus:** That's really valuable insight. Sandra, I want to be respectful of your time. I know we've gone almost to the minute. Any last thoughts?

**Sandra:** No, I think this was great. Honestly, the conversation is helpful for us too. It forces me to articulate what's actually working and what's not. And I think there's real potential for a company like Salesloft or Clari to add value in the legal tech space. It's a unique buying process, and it deserves specialized tools and insights.

**Marcus:** Thank you for being so thoughtful and honest about this. We'll definitely follow up with some thoughts on how we might be able to help.

**Sandra:** Please do. I'm open to conversations.

## Key Takeaways

### 1. Change Management & Law Firm Culture
- **Challenge:** Partner-driven organizations resist software adoption fundamentally. Independent operators view mandates as threats to autonomy.
- **Success Factor:** Focus on quick wins in weeks 2-3, not month 4. Demonstrate personal economic benefit (realization rates, book growth) rather than operational metrics.
- **Sponsor Strategy:** Requires co-sponsorship model—both operational leader (COO) and practice group leader must be aligned.
- **Adoption Reality:** Full rollout often fails. Phased approach targeting immediate, measurable payoff is essential.

### 2. Am Law 200 Procurement Complexity
- **Timeline:** 6-9 month sales cycles now standard (vs. 2-3 months previously).
- **Committee Structure:** Procurement + IT Security + Legal Dept = three veto holders with competing priorities.
- **Key Insight:** Legal operations person at prospect firm (director/VP level) becomes internal translator and advocate.
- **Vendor Management:** SOC 2, security questionnaires, compliance kits are now table stakes, not differentiators.
- **Differentiation:** Can't compete on price or terms due to security/compliance investment requirements.

### 3. Security & Confidentiality Imperative
- **Baseline:** SOC 2 Type II is non-negotiable minimum.
- **Extended Requirements:** GDPR, CCPA, FedRAMP (government-adjacent), encryption standards, incident response protocols.
- **Resource Impact:** Head of security role is essentially "questionnaire answering" and compliance maintenance.
- **Competitive Advantage:** Security excellence filters out tire-kickers and creates customer stickiness.
- **Buying Behavior:** Risk assessment outweighs cost in procurement decisions for Am Law 200.

### 4. Corporate Legal as Secondary Buyer
- **Different Buyer Profile:** GCs care about law spend management, cost control, vendor consolidation (not billable hours).
- **Value Prop:** Demonstrate ROI on vendor relationships, eliminate unnecessary legal work, manage outside counsel performance.
- **Separate Motion:** Usually distinct buying process from law firm buying, though adjacent opportunity exists.
- **Faster Adoption:** Corporate legal is less change-averse, more technology-forward, smaller buying committees.
- **Market Size:** Smaller than law firm market but more sophisticated, efficient sales cycles.

### 5. Billable Hour Economics Misalignment
- **The Paradox:** Tools that improve efficiency can theoretically reduce billable hours, creating structural resistance.
- **Partner Economics:** Individual partner distributions tied directly to billable hours (e.g., 2,000 hrs/year = $5M distribution).
- **Messaging Failure:** "Efficiency" is interpreted as "fewer hours," which threatens compensation.
- **Real Solution:** Shift conversation to capacity utilization—use freed capacity for better clients, higher-value work, alternative fee arrangements.
- **Alternative Fee Arrangements:** Growing 35% of revenue, but requires different value prop (cost management, fixed-fee visibility).
- **Realization Rate Advantage:** Only metric that aligns with partner economics (billing more on same hours = more money).
- **Implementation Reality:** Even improved realization rates (75-80% baseline) require strategic conversation about capacity redeployment.

### 6. Go-to-Market Implications for 2026
- **Consultative Model:** Embed sales engineers and change managers in early sales process.
- **Segment Strategy:** Am Law 10 (enterprise, long cycles, reference value), Am Law 100 (middle market, faster adoption), Mid-market (highest growth, less procurement friction).
- **Community/Advocacy:** Peer influence more powerful than vendor messaging; legal ops summits and practice group forums drive adoption.
- **Market Expansion:** Growth actually coming from specialized practice firms and non-traditional firms, not just Am Law 200.

### 7. Revenue Intelligence Opportunity Gaps
- **Buying Committee Visibility:** Lack of real-time intelligence about procurement committee conversations and stakeholder positions.
- **Competitive Benchmarking:** No industry-standard data on legal tech deal length, sticking points, or standard contract terms.
- **Post-Sale Visibility:** Implementation and adoption tracking limited; early churn signals often missed.
- **Compression Opportunity:** Middle phase of sales cycle (post-interest, pre-signature) takes longest; procurement and security review bottlenecks at prospect end.
- **Potential Solution:** Proactive security/procurement questionnaire responses, better dialogue with actual procurement stakeholders (not just sponsor intermediaries).
