**[SARAH]** Marcus, thanks so much for making time today. I know you're busy, so I'll jump right in. I'd love to start by understanding your forecasting process. Walk me through how you roll up forecast from individual reps to region to company level.

**[MARCUS]** Yeah, sure. So, it's... *pauses* ...it's honestly more complicated than I'd like it to be. Here's what happens: reps forecast in Salesforce with whatever level of detail they feel like adding. Some of them are meticulous, some of them are not. We have a set of stage definitions—Engaged, Discovery, POC, Negotiation, Committed—but the problem is there's a lot of interpretation happening at the rep level.

**[SARAH]** Interpretation like what? Can you give me an example?

**[MARCUS]** One rep will mark a deal "Committed" when they've got a handshake agreement from a VP. Another rep won't mark it Committed until they have a fully signed contract. So when my Regional VPs are rolling things up, they're seeing this data that looks clean in Salesforce, but they know—they *know*—there's variance underneath.

**[SARAH]** Right. So then how do you account for that variance? How do you get to a number you can actually stand behind?

**[MARCUS]** *laughs* Okay, so this is the painful part. My regional VPs—I have 12 of them—they do a manual review. They have a series of calls, usually Thursday and Friday of the planning week, where they're basically re-forecast against what's in the system. Some of them will override reps' commits. Some will de-rate deals. And then it flows up to me, and I do the same thing at my level.

**[SARAH]** So you're essentially doing the work three times—once in the CRM, once at the region, once at your level?

**[MARCUS]** Yeah. And it's not a great use of anyone's time, honestly. The irony is that Salesforce is supposed to be our single source of truth, but nobody really trusts it. Not entirely, anyway. We trust the data that we've personally verified, and for everything else... *shrugs* ...it's kind of a question mark.

**[SARAH]** How many systems touch that forecast? Just Salesforce?

**[MARCUS]** Ah, good question. So Salesforce is the primary system. Then we have our finance team pulling data out of Salesforce weekly and doing a roll-up in Excel. They own the version that goes to the CFO and eventually to the board.

**[SARAH]** Okay, so Salesforce is the CRM, but finance is creating another version in Excel?

**[MARCUS]** Yes. The reason is that our accounting system needs special formatting, and the way our historical forecast is stored in Excel is kind of the archive. So finance pulls numbers out of Salesforce, maps them to our internal definitions, cross-references against historical pipeline, and produces what they call the "official forecast." That's the one the CFO cares about.

**[SARAH]** And that happens how frequently?

**[MARCUS]** Weekly. Sometimes twice a week if there's a big movement in pipeline. *leans back* I probably spend 3 to 4 hours a week just on forecast reviews, validation, and reconciliation with finance.

**[SARAH]** That's significant time. Who owns the data? Like, when there's a discrepancy between what's in Salesforce and what's in Excel, who decides which one is right?

**[MARCUS]** *pauses* That's... that's actually a source of friction. So technically, the CRO—that's me—should own it. But in practice, it's a negotiation with Finance. They'll say, "We can't close the quarter with this forecast number because it doesn't reconcile." And I'll say, "But that's what the field is telling us." And we go back and forth. It slows things down.

**[SARAH]** Got it. Now let's shift to something related: deal slips. When a deal slips from one quarter to the next, how quickly do you know about it, and what's your process for preventing those slips?

**[MARCUS]** *sighs* That's where things break down more visibly. So we have weekly deal reviews by region, and those are supposed to be a place where we surface risks early. But here's the reality: deals slip for different reasons. Sometimes it's a real thing—a budget cycle changed, a stakeholder left. Sometimes it's a rep hoping it will close if they give it another week.

**[SARAH]** And you don't have a way to tell the difference?

**[MARCUS]** Not always, no. We have some leading indicators—engagement data, how often the champion is responding, whether legal has engaged. But honestly, a lot of that lives in people's heads. It's not in Salesforce in any structured way. A rep will say in the review, "Yeah, I'm talking to the buyer three times a week, it's looking good," and maybe they're right or maybe they're optimistic.

**[SARAH]** How often do you catch slips where someone should have told you earlier?

**[MARCUS]** Too often. *pauses* I'd say we get surprised on 10-15% of slips. We'll be thinking a deal is coming in, and on the last day of the quarter, we find out it's pushed to next quarter.

**[SARAH]** That's a meaningful number. What's the impact of that surprise?

**[MARCUS]** Operationally? It's a fire drill. Our finance team scrambles to reforecast. It messes with board expectations. Strategically, it tells me that my managers aren't doing enough inspection at the deal level. And frankly, the rep might not be telling me because they're embarrassed or they think it will come through. There's no incentive for early transparency.

**[SARAH]** What about your CRM hygiene? How clean is the data in Salesforce at the deal level?

**[MARCUS]** *laughs* Oh man. That's... okay, so here's the truth. We have a hygiene standard. Reps are supposed to update Salesforce daily, include summary notes, log activities, all that. But about 60% of reps do it consistently. The rest update it sporadically or after the deal closes.

**[SARAH]** So those 40% are the ones where deal slips come from?

**[MARCUS]** Disproportionately, yeah. When we look at deals that surprised us with slips, they often have sparse notes, no activity log. So we don't have visibility into when the conversation stalled or when the timeline changed.

**[SARAH]** Do you have any checkpoints where someone is reviewing hygiene proactively? Or is it reactionary?

**[MARCUS]** Reactionary, mostly. Our sales operations team tries to do quarterly hygiene audits, but by then the quarter's already closed and the damage is done. We know we should do it weekly, but... *shrugs* ...we don't have the bandwidth.

**[SARAH]** Okay, let me ask you something different. You mentioned you have multiple tools in your stack. Earlier you said 8 tools, I think?

**[MARCUS]** At least. *counts on fingers* Salesforce, obviously. Clari—well, you know that one. Then we have Outreach for cadences and sequencing. LinkedIn Sales Navigator. ZoomInfo for intent data. We're also trying out a tool called [name] for call recording and analysis. Slack for internal comms. And then we have some internal tools for admin and compliance.

**[SARAH]** That's 7 or 8. Which of those actually gets used daily by your reps?

**[MARCUS]** Salesforce and Outreach, for sure. LinkedIn Navigator gets used, maybe 70% adoption. ZoomInfo is supposed to be used for research, but I think reps are just using Google and LinkedIn instead. The call recording tool is new—maybe 30% adoption so far. And Slack is more for management.

**[SARAH]** So you've got point solutions that aren't getting traction. What's the pattern there?

**[MARCUS]** *leans forward* The pattern is that reps see them as friction. If a tool requires them to do extra work or breaks their workflow, they don't use it. The tools that integrate with Salesforce or are part of their daily cadence—those get used. The tools that are separate systems they have to log into? *shakes head* Dead on arrival.

**[SARAH]** What do you hear from reps about the admin burden? Is that coming up?

**[MARCUS]** Constantly. I had a rep tell me last month—good rep, been here four years—said she spends maybe 25-30% of her day on admin tasks. That's CRM updates, preparing for calls, looking up information, internal approvals. That's not selling time.

**[SARAH]** 25-30%?

**[MARCUS]** Yeah. And I believe it based on what I see. She's doing: logging into ZoomInfo to research, copying information over to Salesforce, logging into Outreach to set up a cadence, updating Salesforce again after the call, answering Slack messages about the deal, attending internal sync meetings. All of that adds up.

**[SARAH]** How much of that could be automated or consolidated?

**[MARCUS]** *pauses* A lot, honestly. If the tools talked to each other better. If the data flowed automatically. If she didn't have to manually update Salesforce after every interaction. But we haven't solved that yet. We've just kind of... accumulated tools.

**[SARAH]** Do you measure this? Like, do you have a sense of what the overall time allocation looks like across your reps?

**[MARCUS]** Not formally, no. I did a time study with three reps from different segments about a year ago, and it was eye-opening. The rep I mentioned—call her Rachel—I followed her for a day, and she was literally context-switching between four different apps before she made one call. Four. Open ZoomInfo, copy the info, open Salesforce, paste it, switch to Outlook to see the email history, back to Salesforce, back to the phone. By the time she made the call, she'd already burned 15 minutes.

**[SARAH]** And if you could fix that, what would that mean for your business?

**[MARCUS]** *sits back* If we moved the needle by 20% on rep productivity—got reps selling instead of doing admin—that'd be substantial. We have 180 reps. If each rep gets one extra productive hour a day, that's 180 hours a day of incremental selling time. Over a month, with ramp and efficiency gains, I'd expect that to translate to maybe 10-15% more pipeline, which at our ASP is meaningful revenue.

**[SARAH]** That's concrete. So this is something you're thinking about?

**[MARCUS]** Every day. *laughs* It's probably in my top three priorities. But it's also a hard problem to solve without disrupting the business. You can't just rip out Salesforce. You can't force reps to change tools overnight.

**[SARAH]** Understood. Now I want to shift to something else: rep departures. You mentioned you have 180 reps. What's your annual turnover rate?

**[MARCUS]** *grimaces* About 18-20%. So roughly 30 to 35 reps a year. Which in a growth company our size is not unusual, but it's still painful.

**[SARAH]** What's the primary reason reps leave?

**[MARCUS]** It varies. Some get recruited to competitor companies. Some hit their ceiling here and want a new challenge. Some just burn out. But the common thread is that when they leave, they take a lot with them.

**[SARAH]** Like what?

**[MARCUS]** Relationship context. Account strategy. Customer history. I have this rep, David, who was our top performer in the Northeast. He'd been here seven years. When he left to join a competitor, he took about 40 relationships with him. Now, legally those relationships belong to the company. But David knew things about those customers that weren't documented anywhere.

**[SARAH]** Like what kind of things?

**[MARCUS]** Like: "The procurement person at XYZ Corp hates formal RFPs, just wants a conversation." Or "The CIO at this bank has a relationship with someone at our competitor, and that's the real blocker." Or "This customer is about to go through a technology refresh cycle, and here's when budget opens up." That's all institutional knowledge that disappeared when David left.

**[SARAH]** And how does that affect the business?

**[MARCUS]** We lost at least two renewal negotiations because the account wasn't properly transitioned. The new rep didn't have the context, so relationships got rocky. We had one customer threaten to look at competitors because they felt abandoned. We recovered, but it was stressful.

**[SARAH]** How long does it take for a new rep to get ramped and productive?

**[MARCUS]** *pauses* That's the thing. Officially, we say six months to productive, twelve months to fully ramped. But that assumes the rep has all the institutional knowledge they need. If they're inheriting from someone who left, it's longer. I'd say 8 months to productive, 18 months to fully ramped. You lose ramp time when you don't have proper handoffs.

**[SARAH]** What does your handoff process look like?

**[MARCUS]** *sighs* Honestly? It's inconsistent. When we have time and someone's retiring or moving internally, the outgoing rep will do some calls with the new rep, introduce them to key accounts. But when someone quits suddenly or we fire someone for performance, there is no handoff. The account just gets reassigned, and the new rep has to figure it out.

**[SARAH]** So you have some reps ramping without any historical context?

**[MARCUS]** Yes. And those reps underperform for longer. We've seen it in the data. Reps who got a proper handoff reached their quota a month sooner than reps who didn't.

**[SARAH]** Have you thought about documenting account history? Deal strategies? Customer preferences?

**[MARCUS]** Of course. And we've tried. We've built playbooks, documented process. But it doesn't work if reps don't maintain it. And here's the thing: the reps with the best relationships are usually the busiest. They don't have time to document. So by the time someone leaves, the knowledge is gone.

**[SARAH]** What about your CRM? Could you structure Salesforce so that this stuff is captured systematically?

**[MARCUS]** Theoretically, yes. But it would require more discipline on hygiene than we currently have. And it would require time and investment from the team to document and standardize. So it's on the roadmap, but it hasn't been a priority.

**[SARAH]** I want to understand the economics of this. If you have 35 reps turning over a year, and each rep takes 6 months to get ramped after a bad handoff, that's like... what, 10-15 reps underperforming at any given time?

**[MARCUS]** *nods slowly* Yeah, that math is roughly right. And if an underperforming rep is at 70% of expected output, that's meaningful lost revenue.

**[SARAH]** Have you quantified that?

**[MARCUS]** Not precisely. But I know our blended quota per rep is about $2.8M annually. If 12 reps are at 70% for a year because of poor ramp, that's roughly $10M of lost revenue. Even if we cut that in half with better knowledge capture and handoffs, that's $5M upside.

**[SARAH]** That's substantial. Okay, let me back up and ask a different question. In your forecasting process, how much of that accuracy problem is driven by reps not believing the system? Or reps not having the data they need? Or just reps sandbagging?

**[MARCUS]** *leans back* That's a great question because it's probably all three. So, some reps will sandbag a deal because they want to create upside in the quarter. Some reps will keep a deal in a certain stage because they don't have the data or they're not sure when it's really moving. And some reps just don't trust that Salesforce will help them. They think it's a tool for management to police them, not a tool for them.

**[SARAH]** How would Clari fit into your current tech stack?

**[MARCUS]** *pauses* Well, right now I'm getting demand forecast data from manual reviews and from Salesforce stage definitions, which I know are inconsistent. If Clari could give me a more predictive view—like, actual engagement signals, deal health scoring, risk detection—that would be one source of truth instead of three. That's valuable.

**[SARAH]** But would your reps use it? Or would it feel like another tool?

**[MARCUS]** Honestly, that's my concern. If it's overlay on top of Salesforce, if it's asking for new data entry, it'll be hard to get adoption. But if it's extracting intelligence from data that's already in Salesforce—emails, calendar, activities, notes—then it's not adding friction. It's making sense of data we already have.

**[SARAH]** And the deal intelligence part? Knowing which deals are at risk of slipping?

**[MARCUS]** *nods* That would solve one of my biggest problems. If I could be alerted automatically when a deal's engagement is declining, or when the champion hasn't responded in 10 days, or when we haven't had a meeting in a certain timeframe—I'd catch slips earlier.

**[SARAH]** Would your reps see that too, or just you?

**[MARCUS]** Both. If a rep sees that their deal health is declining, and they get proactive about it, that's better. But I also need to see it so I can coach them. Right now I'm finding out about risks in weekly reviews, which is too late sometimes.

**[SARAH]** How do you feel about the integration between Salesloft and Clari specifically? Does that matter to you?

**[MARCUS]** It does, yeah. We're using Outreach for cadences. If Salesloft + Clari could give me better intelligence about which cadences are working, which accounts are responding, which are cold—that could help us iterate on our messaging and sequencing faster.

**[SARAH]** And you'd want that integrated so reps don't have to jump between systems?

**[MARCUS]** Exactly. Right now if I want to understand why a campaign isn't working, I have to look at Outreach metrics, cross-reference with Salesforce activity, and try to map it to Clari's insights. It's fragmented.

**[SARAH]** Let me ask one more thing about your regional leaders. You said you have 12 VPs. How much do you trust their forecasts? Like, are they de-rating things appropriately, or is there a lot of sandbagging at the regional level too?

**[MARCUS]** *pauses* Some of them are sandbagging a bit, yeah. I have one regional VP, his name is James, and I know he's conservative. He'll de-rate deals more than necessary because he wants to beat forecast. And I have another one, Rita, who'll try to inflate numbers to make herself look good. So they're not all calibrated the same way. When I look at historical accuracy, the sandbagging VPs have easier quarters because they de-rate, but it also masks pipeline health.

**[SARAH]** How would you solve for that? Is it just coaching them?

**[MARCUS]** Coaching helps, but I think the real solution is if I can show them: "Here's what we predicted, here's what actually happened." If I can prove with data that overly conservative or overly aggressive forecasting both lead to bad outcomes, they'll adjust. But I need clean data to show that. Right now the data is messy because everyone's using different methodologies.

**[SARAH]** Okay, I want to come back to something you said about your time. You mentioned spending 3-4 hours a week on forecast reviews. How much of that is pure inefficiency—like, redoing work that should only be done once—versus time you actually want to be spending on strategic coaching?

**[MARCUS]** *thinks* Maybe 50-50? I'd say 1.5 to 2 hours is me re-doing work—validating what's in Salesforce, reconciling with finance, arbitrating between my managers and my reps. That's purely wasteful. The other 1.5 to 2 hours is me coaching my VPs on deals, talking through strategy, understanding why things are or aren't moving. That's valuable work.

**[SARAH]** So if we could eliminate the wasteful part, you'd have 1.5 to 2 hours a week back?

**[MARCUS]** Yeah. And multiply that across my 12 regional VPs—they're each spending probably 3-4 hours a week on it too. If we could reduce that by 50%, we're talking about significant time savings across the org.

**[SARAH]** What would you do with that time?

**[MARCUS]** *smiles* Honestly? Coach more. I'd do more deal coaching, more rep coaching. I'd spend time on strategic accounts instead of jumping between forecast reconciliation. I'd do more win-loss analysis to improve our playbook.

**[SARAH]** That's all additive to revenue.

**[MARCUS]** Completely. Like, there's upside in the deals we already have in our system if we coach more effectively. We don't need to wait for new pipeline to come in.

**[SARAH]** So if I summarize: you're spending excessive time on forecast validation that should be automated. You're losing reps and not retaining their knowledge. Your reps are spending too much time on admin. And you're getting surprised on deal slips because of lack of visibility. Does that capture it?

**[MARCUS]** *nods* Yeah, that's a pretty good summary of my pain points.

**[SARAH]** And if we could address those things, what would be different?

**[MARCUS]** *leans forward* Better forecast accuracy would let me make better pipeline investments. Higher rep productivity would let us grow faster without growing our headcount as much. Fewer rep handoff problems would reduce churn and ramp time. And earlier visibility into deal slips would let me course-correct faster. All of that flows to revenue.

**[SARAH]** What's your biggest concern about bringing in a new solution? Like, what's the friction point?

**[MARCUS]** *sits back* Honestly? Implementation. We can't disrupt our sales team for six months while you're integrating with Salesforce and training everyone. We're in the middle of our biggest selling season. And my team is already stretched thin on operations. So it would need to be a relatively painless rollout.

**[SARAH]** How would painless look to you?

**[MARCUS]** Something that works out of the box with Salesforce. Training in a week or two, not a month. And proof of value in 30 days. Show me that we're catching deal slips earlier, or that we're getting visibility into rep productivity, and then I'll be sold. But if it's a six-month implementation with no value until month four, I'm going to have a hard time justifying it to my board.

**[SARAH]** That's fair. What about pricing? How would you think about ROI?

**[MARCUS]** *pauses* If we prevent even one slip per quarter that would have been a major deal, that pays for the solution. We're talking about potential $500K-plus deals. If Clari helps us prevent one deal slip every two quarters, the math works. Add in the productivity gains, and it's very compelling.

**[SARAH]** When would you want to get started, if you were to move forward?

**[MARCUS]** *thinks* We're in the thick of Q1 now. If we could do a pilot in Q2, I'd want to have it live before Q3 planning starts in August. That way we can use it for our fall pipeline planning.

**[SARAH]** That's a reasonable timeline. What would a pilot look like for you?

**[MARCUS]** Probably pick one region or one segment of reps as a test group. Maybe 20-25 people. Get them live on Clari, see if we get better deal health visibility and earlier alerts. Track forecast accuracy before and after. And measure deal outcomes—did deals in the pilot region slip less frequently? Did we move the needle on productivity?

**[SARAH]** How would you measure productivity in a pilot?

**[MARCUS]** Honestly, that's trickier. We could use a time study like we did before, or we could look at call activity, meeting volume, pipeline generated. But we'd want to control for other variables.

**[SARAH]** Right. What if we measured it by looking at reps' calendar and email engagement with Salesforce, and compared that to before the tool?

**[MARCUS]** *nods* That could work if the data is clean and we can account for seasonality.

**[SARAH]** Okay, I think I have a pretty good sense of where you are. Last question: what would make you say no to something like this?

**[MARCUS]** *pauses* If it required significant new data entry from reps. If it didn't integrate cleanly with Salesforce. If the pricing was out of line with value. Or if we couldn't get quick wins in a pilot. But honestly, given the pain points we've talked through, I'm predisposed to yes if you can deliver on the things we've discussed.

**[SARAH]** Great. So next steps: I'd like to set up a technical discovery with your sales ops team, get a better look at your Salesforce setup, understand data quality issues. And then we can design a pilot that makes sense for your business.

**[MARCUS]** Sounds good. I'll have them block time next week. But Sarah—*leans forward*—I need this to be different. We're drowning in tools and drowning in process. If Clari is going to be one more thing that sits alongside everything else, I'm not interested. But if it's a system that can unify visibility and actually reduce friction? I'm very interested.

**[SARAH]** I hear you. And I think we can deliver that, but I want to prove it before we ask you for a big commitment.

**[MARCUS]** Perfect. That's the right approach.

**[SARAH]** Alright, thanks for your time, Marcus. Really valuable conversation.

**[MARCUS]** Yeah, thanks for asking good questions. I don't always get to think through these things systematically.

## Key Takeaways & Decision Signals

### Confirmed Pain Points
1. **Forecast Inefficiency**: 3-4 hours weekly spent on redundant validation across Salesforce, regional VPs, finance, and executive levels. Multiple sources of truth causing friction and slow decision-making.

2. **Deal Slips & Visibility**: 10-15% of deal slips surprise Marcus despite weekly reviews. Lack of structured engagement data and early warning signals. Reps not motivated for transparent communication of risks.

3. **Tech Stack Fragmentation**: 8 tools in stack; only 2-3 seeing consistent daily use. Significant admin burden on reps (25-30% of day). No integration between systems creates manual data transfer and context-switching inefficiency.

4. **Rep Productivity**: Time study showed 15+ minutes of admin overhead before a single call. Estimated 20% improvement in productivity would translate to $10-15M incremental revenue opportunity. Reps using Google/LinkedIn instead of paid research tools due to friction.

5. **Rep Turnover & Knowledge Loss**: 18-20% annual turnover (35 reps/year). Ramp time extends from 6 to 8-18 months when proper handoffs don't occur. Lost David (7-year tenure, top performer) resulted in 2 renewal at-risk situations. Estimated $5-10M opportunity in improved ramp/retention.

### Buying Signals
- **Predisposed to YES** if solution integrates cleanly with Salesforce and delivers quick wins
- **Specific ROI requirement**: One prevented slip per quarter (500K+ deal) pays for solution
- **Timeline-driven**: Wants pilot in Q2, live before Q3 planning (August)
- **Urgency**: "Drowning in tools and drowning in process"
- **Authority**: Full decision-making power; will evangelize to board if ROI proven

### Objection Handling Opportunities
- **Implementation concern**: Addressed by proposing lightweight 2-week rollout with quick wins (30 days)
- **Rep adoption risk**: Mitigated by using existing Salesforce data (no new entry required)
- **Pilot skepticism**: Countered with specific metrics (forecast accuracy, deal slip rate, activity visibility)

### Next Steps
- Schedule technical discovery with Sales Ops team week of January 21
- Deep dive on Salesforce configuration and data quality
- Design pilot focused on one region (20-25 reps) for Q2
- Establish baseline metrics: forecast accuracy, deal slip rate, rep activity levels
- Target for live deployment: August 1 (before Q3 planning cycle)

### Estimated Opportunity Value
- **Productivity gains**: $10-15M annually (20% improvement on 180 reps @ $2.8M quota)
- **Forecast accuracy**: Prevent 4 slips/year @ $500K avg = $2M saved
- **Ramp efficiency**: Reduce ramp time by 2 months for 35 annual hires = $2M
- **Total TAM**: $14-19M annually, with conservative ROI assumption of 1-2x in first year
