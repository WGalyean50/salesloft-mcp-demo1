## Conversation Structure

Sets the stage for the dual sales motion and establishes Michelle's background managing both corporate and franchisee channels.

### 2. Pricing Sensitivity & Labor Market Dynamics (5:45)
Deep dive into thin restaurant margins (5-12%) and how labor market shock (15-20% wage increases) shifted messaging from growth to survival and labor efficiency.

### 3. Corporate Mandates vs. Franchisee Power (5:45)
Reveals that mandates aren't absolute—franchisees have leverage, and successful implementations can create bottoms-up demand that influences corporate decisions.

### 4. Churn & Retention Fundamentals (8:30)
Critical segment: monthly churn varies from 0.8-1.2% (mandated) to 4-5% (independent), annualizing to 28-35%. Details the retention playbook and CAC/LTV variance.

### 5. Delivery Platform Integration (5:30)
Establishes delivery as 30-50% of revenue, requiring native integration. Discusses API maintenance costs and strategic partnership opportunities with DoorDash, Uber Eats, Grubhub.

### 6. Strategic Priorities & Segmentation (4:00)
Closing section with three key priorities: reduce churn, target high-LTV franchisees (10-50 units), and formalize platform partnerships.

## Core Talking Points Addressed

### 1. Franchisee vs. Corporate Buying
✓ **Corporate (30% revenue):** Centralized procurement, cleaner handoff, predictable expansion
✓ **Franchisees (70% revenue):** Thousands of independent operators, each making ROI decisions
✓ **Dual motion complexity:** Different buyer personas, different timelines, different value props
✓ **Franchisee influence:** Bottom-up success drives corporate investment and peer adoption

### 2. Thin Margins & Price Sensitivity
✓ **Restaurant net margins:** 5-8% typical, 10-12% for strong operators
✓ **ROI requirement:** 60-90 day payback or franchisees churn
✓ **Custom modeling:** Michelle hires dedicated person for labor ROI calculations
✓ **No aspirational selling:** Every feature must directly save money or make money

### 3. Labor Market Shifts
✓ **Wage pressure:** 15-20% year-over-year increases
✓ **Messaging shift:** From growth/scale to survival and labor efficiency
✓ **Value driver:** "Do more with fewer people" replaced "double throughput"
✓ **Segment variance:** Large franchisees think strategically; single-unit operators focus on survival

### 4. Delivery Platform Integration
✓ **Revenue impact:** 30-50% of restaurant sales now from delivery
✓ **Table stakes:** Must integrate with DoorDash, Uber Eats, Grubhub or "you're dead"
✓ **Maintenance burden:** APIs change regularly; Uber Eats API rebuild took 1 week
✓ **Strategic risk:** Grubhub pushed own software; API access could be cut off
✓ **Partnership opportunity:** Platform reps can recommend tool; co-selling and revenue share explored

### 5. High SMB Churn & Retention Strategy
✓ **Churn spread:** 0.8-1.2% monthly (mandated) vs. 4-5% monthly (independent)
✓ **Annualized:** 28-35% is unsustainable and driven by business downturns, oversold ROI, vendor fatigue
✓ **Retention tactics:** Human onboarding, peer community, NRR-tied sales comp
✓ **CAC/LTV variance:** 100-150% acceptable for corporate; 4-5x required for independents
✓ **Expansion potential:** 55% of revenue from expansion within existing customers vs. 45% new

## Strategic Recommendations (From Michelle)

### Priority 1: Churn Reduction
- Implement segmented retention motion
- Target 2% or lower monthly churn across all segments
- Current state: Losing high-LTV expansion opportunity with every churn

### Priority 2: High-LTV Franchisee Targeting
- Focus on 10-50 location operators
- These drive 50-55% of revenue but get insufficient attention
- 20+ location operators have different buying criteria and much higher LTV

### Priority 3: Formalize Platform Partnerships
- Move from transactional to strategic relationships with delivery platforms
- Explore co-selling, revenue sharing, co-branded solutions
- Currently reactive; should be proactive

### Priority 4: Segment-Specific Messaging
- Corporate: Standardization, compliance, multi-unit visibility
- High-LTV franchisees: Operational excellence, labor optimization
- SMB: Simplicity, quick ROI
- Current state: Generic positioning across all segments

### Priority 5: Churn Prediction Model
- Correlate implementation speed (14-day onboarding is leading indicator)
- Layer franchisee business metrics: net revenue growth, labor cost %, employment stability
- Early usage patterns have signal but need business context

## Notable Quotes

> "Corporate cares about brand consistency, compliance reporting, territory management. Franchisees care about: 'Will this make my life easier? Will I get the money back? How much am I paying, and what am I getting?'"

> "Restaurant margins are genuinely thin...A software tool that costs $500 a month needs to either directly save you money or directly make you money—ideally both."

> "We're selling automation. We're selling labor efficiency...You don't have to hire two more people. One person with our system does the job of 1.5 people with spreadsheets."

> "A corporate mandate on its surface sounds great...but franchisees have more leverage than you'd think."

> "Franchisees literally drove corporate buying decisions because they saw results from other brands. That's word-of-mouth at scale, and it's powerful."

> "We don't have a bulletproof model yet [for churn prediction]. Right now, we're flying somewhat blind."

> "We're not buying software—we're buying hours, labor, margin, and survival. If your tool doesn't deliver that, it doesn't matter how good the software is."
