**[SALESLOFT REP]** Good morning, Patricia. Thanks so much for taking the time. I know you're busy. I've been following Integration Platform's growth—you've done some really impressive things in the IPaaS space. And frankly, given your ARR and the complexity of your sales motion, I think we can have a meaningful conversation about where you're seeing friction. Fair?

**[PATRICIA]** Yeah, appreciate it. Honestly, we're at an inflection point. We hit $95M ARR last year, which is great, but our growth rate has plateaued. We're seeing some dynamics in our sales cycle that are becoming increasingly painful. So yeah, let's dig in.

**[SALESLOFT REP]** Perfect. Let me start with something I'm hearing from a lot of platforms like you. A lot of your customers come in through developers or technical buyers—bottom-up. But then the deal stalls before you can get executive involvement. Are you seeing that?

**[PATRICIA]** Oh man, that's *the* problem right now. So we have a really strong developer community. They love our product. The net promoter score for developers using Integration Platform is phenomenal—I think it's around 72. But here's the thing: when a developer adopts us in a department, say finance or ops, they're using us to solve a specific problem. They've built workflow around it, integration's working fine. But when it comes time to buy, when procurement gets involved, suddenly we're competing on price. The developer champion is asking, "Why are we paying for this? We already have it working." And the finance team is like, "Well, let's look at alternatives."

**[SALESLOFT REP]** So you're not getting to executive value conversation?

**[PATRICIA]** Exactly. That's the gap. We're solving a tactical problem, but we're not connecting it to—I don't know—cost avoidance, headcount savings, time to market. You know? We're not talking about what happens if this integration fails, or what it costs the company if this developer has to maintain it manually. We're just... existing. And that makes us a cost center that procurement can squeeze.

**[SALESLOFT REP]** So the expansion motion—going from that one department or team to enterprise—you're not really equipped to manage that. You need someone who understands how to take a developer champion and build a multi-threading strategy around them, right?

**[PATRICIA]** Right. And here's the other thing. We actually *do* have Account Executives managing these accounts once they become customers. But by the time we hand off from Sales Development to AE, the deal is already on life support. We're negotiating, the champion is tired, and we're trying to retrofit a business case that should have been built three months ago.

**[SALESLOFT REP]** Let me ask you about the champion dynamic, because this feeds into what I want to ask next. When you lose a champion—and I assume you're seeing this—how does that impact the deal?

**[PATRICIA]** *[Sighs]* It's brutal. Last year, we had a $2.2M deal with a financial services company. The champion was a VP of engineering. Super engaged, understood our value, was excited about the partnership. We're in the final stages—legal review, board approval, the whole thing. The VP gets a promotion. He moves to another team internally, different division. All of a sudden, the new person doesn't have the context, doesn't trust us the way he did. The deal goes from "closing next quarter" to "let's revisit this in six months." And six months later? They've already bought something else or they've decided to build it in-house.

**[SALESLOFT REP]** So you're not multi-threading enough early?

**[PATRICIA]** We *try* to multi-thread, but honestly, Marcus, it's hard in our space because a lot of the value is technical. The developers get it. The CTOs and VPs of Engineering get it. But getting to a CFO or a CRO and saying, "Here's why this integration platform matters"—we struggle with that. I don't think our narrative is strong enough for that conversation.

**[SALESLOFT REP]** And if you had mapped the organization earlier, had a relationship with finance, or ops, or whoever owns the budget...

**[PATRICIA]** Yeah. The problem is, our sales team—and I'll own this—is incentivized on closing individual deals, not on relationship mapping or account expansion. So they check the box: "Multi-threading? Check. We have three stakeholders." But those stakeholders are all in Engineering. And none of them have budget authority. When the champion leaves, the deal falls apart because nobody else cares as much.

**[SALESLOFT REP]** Let's talk about deal velocity then. Because if you're doing multi-year deals and the sales cycle is long, but also you're losing champions and losing momentum, what does the pipeline health look like?

**[PATRICIA]** The pipeline is... complicated. So our typical deal cycle is 8 to 12 months. We've had some close in 6 months if there's a specific trigger—like they're migrating legacy systems, or they're onboarding a new partner and need integrations. But the default? 8 to 12. And within that window, there are so many things that can go wrong.

**[SALESLOFT REP]** Give me an example of a 12-month deal. Walk me through it.

**[PATRICIA]** Okay. So a customer—let's call them Company A, a logistics company doing about $500M in revenue—they discover us. A developer in their supply chain team is frustrated with their current integration approach. He Googles, finds us, spins up a dev instance, shows some colleagues. They love it. Three months go by. Usage grows. Then, somebody in IT says, "Wait, we need to evaluate this formally." Now we've got procurement involved.

The procurement team, right, they don't understand the value. They see us as an implementation cost. They say, "Okay, we can buy this, or we can connect an ERP consultant for a project fee." So now we're in a competitive evaluation. That takes another two months.

Then we finally get to a business case conversation. We're looking at three-year pricing, multi-year discounts. Their CFO starts asking about implementation timelines. *That's* when we hit the technical validation phase.

**[SALESLOFT REP]** And that's three months, you said?

**[PATRICIA]** At least. For a complex organization with legacy systems, integrations need to be tested in their environment. We have to work with their IT team, their infrastructure team, their data security team. If they're regulated—and a lot of our customers are—we're going through compliance reviews, SOC 2 audits, data residency questions. And they usually do this in parallel with evaluating competitors. So they're testing Boomi, they're testing MuleSoft, they're testing us.

And here's the killer: our implementation is on us. Their IT resources are overallocated. We're asking them to dedicate people to this project, and they say yes, but then their roadmap shifts. A migration goes sideways. Suddenly, the people who were supposed to help us validate are dealing with a production issue. And we slip another month.

**[SALESLOFT REP]** So you're looking at, conservatively, eight months before they even *know* if the technical implementation is viable?

**[PATRICIA]** Easily. And then, after the technical validation is successful, there's still contract negotiation, legal review, security review, sometimes procurement needs to go back to their finance team for budget approval. I've had deals that technically validated in month six, but didn't close until month fourteen.

**[SALESLOFT REP]** And during all of that time, what's happening with your AE and champion? Are they staying engaged?

**[PATRICIA]** Sometimes. But fatigue sets in. The champion is tired of talking about it. The AE is watching the deal sit in the pipeline with no movement. Our commission plan incentivizes closing, not managing long-cycle deals. So the AE's attention drifts to a newer opportunity that might close faster. And the champion, if he hasn't already left the company, is thinking, "Maybe this isn't worth it."

**[SALESLOFT REP]** Which ties back to the champion leaving problem.

**[PATRICIA]** Exactly. And then you've got the financing conversation, which is another whole issue.

**[SALESLOFT REP]** Let's go there. Multi-year deals and cash flow. What's the dynamic?

**[PATRICIA]** So we typically structure deals as three-year commitments. That's our standard. But a $95M ARR company selling to enterprises, a three-year deal could be $500K, $800K, $1.2M, depending on usage. That's real money for our customers' CFOs. They're looking at whether they can justify that commitment, whether they need board approval for large procurement, whether it impacts their cash flow forecasts.

And frankly, we're not equipped to have that conversation. Our AEs are good at sales, but they're not sophisticated around deal structure. We'll get a request for a two-year deal instead of three, and we say no. Or we'll get a request for a quarterly renewal instead of an upfront commitment, and we say no. We're rigid. And that rigidity kills deals.

**[SALESLOFT REP]** So customers are asking for flexibility, and you're not giving it?

**[PATRICIA]** We can't, really. Our finance model is built around upfront annual commitments or multi-year commitments. A quarterly renewal model breaks our forecasting. Our board wants visibility into committed revenue. They want predictability. But that's a constraint that our sales team has to operate within, and sometimes the customer is willing to buy, but they can't buy the way we're selling.

**[SALESLOFT REP]** Have you thought about alternative deal structures? Like, what if you offered financing options, or milestone-based payment structures?

**[PATRICIA]** We've talked about it. The CFO is skeptical. She thinks we'd end up with negative unit economics. But I think there's a middle ground. Like, what if we offered two pricing tracks: a traditional upfront annual fee, and then a "land and expand" model where they pay a smaller upfront fee, and then we grow into higher usage tiers over three years?

But here's the constraint: our board is also pushing us to accelerate growth. They see competitors raising at higher valuations, and they're asking, "Why aren't we closing faster?" So we've got this interesting pressure where we're told to accelerate sales velocity, but our product and deal structure are fundamentally built around a long, complex sales cycle.

**[SALESLOFT REP]** And that's where I think a lot of teams struggle. You're being pulled in two directions. Okay, so let me ask you about competitive dynamics. Because given everything you've described—the long cycle, the champion leaving, the technical validation—when a competitor enters the conversation, how does that impact you?

**[PATRICIA]** *[Pauses]* That's actually where we're losing deals right now. We're not losing to price typically. We're losing because a competitor comes in with better timing, or with a different story, or because they've already built relationships with people on the buying committee that we haven't.

Like, the classic scenario: we're in late-stage evaluation with a prospect. We've done months of work. We've validated the technical fit. We're waiting on legal review and budget sign-off. And then, out of nowhere, the prospect's CIO bumps into an old colleague at a conference who works at Boomi, and suddenly there's this new conversation happening in parallel.

**[SALESLOFT REP]** And you don't know about it until it's too late.

**[PATRICIA]** Right. Or, we know about it because the prospect mentions it, but at that point, we've already spent so much energy on the deal that we're reactive instead of proactive. We're defending our position instead of making the case for why we're the right partner.

**[SALESLOFT REP]** So the intent signal is not just about them showing interest in you. It's about them showing interest in *everyone*, right? Like, if you could see when they're actively evaluating alternatives, you could adjust your strategy.

**[PATRICIA]** Yeah, I think that's huge. And honestly, even before that. If we could see intent that they're *thinking* about solving this problem—like, they're hiring integration engineers, or they're migrating their data warehouse, or they're consolidating vendors—we could engage earlier in the process, before they've committed to an evaluation with someone else.

**[SALESLOFT REP]** Do you have any tools for that right now?

**[PATRICIA]** We use some intent data tools, but they're fairly blunt. We see firmographic data—like, "This company is a good fit for us." But we're not capturing enough about *why* they're showing up in conversations, or *when* they're in the market. And by the time our sales team gets a lead, it's usually too late.

**[SALESLOFT REP]** So you're leaving money on the table by not engaging earlier.

**[PATRICIA]** Definitely. And the other piece is competitive intelligence. Like, right now, if a prospect mentions they're talking to Boomi, I don't have a playbook for how to position against Boomi. I'm not even sure what their actual pitch is. Are they emphasizing ease of use? Speed of implementation? Price? I don't know. So I'm flying blind.

**[SALESLOFT REP]** And your team is probably just being reactive—like, "Here's why we're better."

**[PATRICIA]** Exactly. "We have better APIs. We have better customer support." But that's generic. That's not addressing what Boomi is actually selling. And if the prospect has already bought into Boomi's narrative, then my team is basically starting from zero.

**[SALESLOFT REP]** Okay, so let me synthesize what I'm hearing. You've got this interesting cluster of problems, right? You've got a bottom-up adoption that's not converting to expansion because your team isn't mapping the organization or building an executive narrative early. You've got champions leaving because you're not multi-threading enough, and by the time you realize the champion is gone, the deal is already dead. You've got a long sales cycle that's creating fatigue and momentum loss. You've got financing and deal structure constraints that are actually blocking customers from buying. And you've got a competitive environment where you don't have visibility into intent or a coherent competitive strategy. Does that feel right?

**[PATRICIA]** *[Long pause]* Yeah. That's... yeah, that's accurate. And it's frustrating because the product is good. We're not losing to product. We're losing to sales process.

**[SALESLOFT REP]** So here's what I think is important: a lot of these problems can be addressed with the right data, the right process, and the right tools. But it requires you to shift your thinking. Right now, your sales team is optimized for closing individual deals. What you need is a team optimized for *managing relationships* across the buying committee, *managing intent* so you're engaging at the right time, and *managing process* so deals don't stall.

That's where Salesloft and Clari come in. Salesloft gives you visibility into every conversation happening on an account. So you can see which stakeholders are engaged, when the last conversation was, what the sentiment is. Clari gives you dynamic forecasting and deal intelligence so you can see, in real-time, if a deal is actually progressing or if it's stalling.

**[PATRICIA]** I'm listening. But I want to be honest: we've looked at some of these tools before. Our team has said, "We don't need Salesforce 2.0. We need to close deals faster." How is this going to help us close deals faster?

**[SALESLOFT REP]** That's a fair question. And the answer is, it's not going to directly close deals faster. What it's going to do is compress the sales cycle by making sure that the time you're investing in each deal is being spent on the right activities. Right now, you're probably spending a lot of time in conversations that aren't moving the deal forward. Or you're not aware that a deal has stalled until it's too late to course-correct.

With Salesloft, your AEs are doing Salesloft with every prospect—emails, calls, tasks, outcomes. And you can see, at a glance, if a champion is disengaged. If their email open rate drops, if they're not responding, you know to go multi-thread. With Clari, you can forecast more accurately, which means you're not surprised when deals slip, and you can adjust your pipeline strategy accordingly.

**[PATRICIA]** How does that actually work? Like, I don't want a tool that just tells me "this deal is stalling." I want a tool that helps me *do something about it*.

**[SALESLOFT REP]** Good. So let's say you have a deal that's sitting in legal review. The champion is the VP of Engineering. With Salesloft, you can see that you haven't talked to the finance person in six weeks. So you generate a multi-threading plan: AE calls the CFO to understand budget constraints. You call the Procurement Manager to understand the procurement timeline. You reach out to the Chief Legal Officer to understand the legal review status.

Salesloft helps you coordinate those conversations. It tells you who needs to say yes, when, and in what order. And it makes sure your team is collectively moving the deal, not just the champion.

**[PATRICIA]** Okay, that makes sense. But what about the competitive piece? You mentioned Clari earlier. Does that tell you when a competitor is in the deal?

**[SALESLOFT REP]** Clari has some competitive intelligence capabilities, but it's limited. Where it's more powerful is in deal dynamics. Clari looks at all the signals—is the customer engaged? Are they asking the right questions? Are they buying stakeholders aligned? And it generates a health score. If the health score is declining and you're in a competitive situation, you know you need to move faster or adjust your position.

But for competitive intelligence specifically, that's where you need to layer in additional tools. There are companies like Demandbase, 6sense, and others that specialize in intent data. They can tell you when a customer is actively searching for solutions like yours, when they're engaging with competitors' websites, that kind of thing.

**[PATRICIA]** So it's not a silver bullet.

**[SALESLOFT REP]** No. But here's what I think: if you combine real-time visibility into your deals with better intent data and a more disciplined sales process, you're going to see a meaningful reduction in sales cycle. Not a 50% reduction—that's not realistic given your product complexity. But maybe 15-20%. Which, if you're doing $95M ARR and your ASP is $300K-500K, means you're closing another 20-30 deals a year. That's another $6-15M ARR.

**[PATRICIA]** *[Pause]* That's not nothing. But I also need to think about implementation. How disruptive is this to our current sales process?

**[SALESLOFT REP]** Depends on your current state. What tools are you using right now?

**[PATRICIA]** Salesforce is the core system. We use HubSpot for marketing. We have some internal tools for pricing and configuration. We don't use much beyond that. Our AEs are pretty self-directed. They do their own outreach, manage their own accounts.

**[SALESLOFT REP]** Okay, so Salesloft integrates with Salesforce. Your AEs would probably see it as a layer on top of Salesforce—a place where they're managing activities, calls, emails, that stuff. They're not re-entering data. We pull directly from Salesforce. For Clari, similar thing. We pull forecast data from Salesforce, we add our intelligence layer on top, and your deal managers or sales leaders are looking at a live dashboard.

The implementation is probably four to six weeks. The biggest lift is usually getting your team to be disciplined about logging activities and outcomes. But if your AEs are already doing that, it's pretty straightforward.

**[PATRICIA]** And what about adoption? How long before we see an impact?

**[SALESLOFT REP]** That depends on your team and your sales process. But in my experience, if you have executive sponsorship, if you're willing to change compensation or focus to reward pipeline management, not just closes, you can see movement in two or three months. Within six months, you should see a material improvement in deal velocity.

**[PATRICIA]** Let me ask you a different question. You mentioned earlier that we're losing deals to competitive displacement. You said Boomi, MuleSoft, others. How does Clari help with that if we don't even know they're in the deal?

**[SALESLOFT REP]** That's where the deal health score comes in. Clari is going to tell you, pretty reliably, if a deal is moving at the expected pace. If it's not, one of the reasons is competitor intervention. So you should be proactively asking, "Who else are you evaluating?" And the tools are going to help you see if the customer is being evasive or if they're genuinely still deciding.

But for knowing about competitors *before* they're in the deal, that's where intent data comes in. And that's a separate tool. We partner with some of those vendors, but Clari doesn't do that natively.

**[PATRICIA]** So I need to buy multiple tools.

**[SALESLOFT REP]** Most enterprises do. But here's the thing: you're probably already bleeding money due to long sales cycles, lost deals, and pipeline visibility issues. The cost of a few point solutions is a rounding error compared to the upside.

**[PATRICIA]** I hear that. But I also need to think about the board conversation. If I'm asking for budget for sales tools, I need to justify it to my CFO. What's the business case?

**[SALESLOFT REP]** That's fair. So let's build it out. Your ARR is $95M. Let's assume your net expansion rate is—what, 110%?

**[PATRICIA]** About that, maybe 108%.

**[SALESLOFT REP]** Okay. So you're growing, but you want to accelerate. Your board is asking for 30%+ growth. That means you need to close faster and close bigger deals. Right now, what's your sales efficiency? Like, how much are you spending on sales and marketing to get to $95M ARR?

**[PATRICIA]** We're at about 40% of revenue on S&M. So $38M a year.

**[SALESLOFT REP]** And what's your quota attainment?

**[PATRICIA]** About 90% of the team hits quota. Some over, some under.

**[SALESLOFT REP]** Okay, so there's slack there. Now, here's the math: if you can improve quota attainment from 90% to 95% through better pipeline visibility and deal management, that's another 5% of your AE productivity. Assuming you have, what, 30-40 AEs?

**[PATRICIA]** About 35.

**[SALESLOFT REP]** So 35 AEs, average ASP of $400K, that's $14M in incremental revenue from just improving attainment by 5%. Cost of Salesloft and Clari for 35 AEs? Maybe $200-250K a year. So you're looking at a 50x return.

And that's just the conservative case. If you also reduce sales cycle from 10 months to 8.5 months, you get even more benefit: you're compressing your pipeline, which means you need fewer pipeline coverage months outstanding. That frees up cash.

**[PATRICIA]** The CFO would probably want to see pilot results before committing to enterprise implementation.

**[SALESLOFT REP]** That's smart. So what we typically do is: pick your top 10 AEs, or your most complex deals. Run them through Salesloft and Clari for 90 days. Track outcomes, deal velocity, forecast accuracy. If it works, you go enterprise. If it doesn't, you've learned something.

**[PATRICIA]** How much would a pilot cost?

**[SALESLOFT REP]** For a pilot, let's say $10K for three months. Salesloft licenses for 10 people, Clari for your sales leader or two. After 90 days, if you want to proceed, that $10K rolls into your first annual commitment, which would probably be $200-250K depending on your team size and Clari features.

**[PATRICIA]** And you've got references? Companies like us who have gone through this?

**[SALESLOFT REP]** Yeah, absolutely. I can introduce you to a couple of Platform-as-a-Service companies we work with. One is doing about $110M ARR, another is around $75M. Both have similar sales dynamics to you—long cycles, multiple stakeholders, technical buyers who don't have budget authority. Both saw meaningful improvements in deal velocity after implementing.

**[PATRICIA]** I appreciate that. Let me think about this. I want to talk to my Chief Revenue Officer about it. But I have to say, this resonates. We *are* leaving money on the table with our current process. And if there's a way to get more discipline into our sales org without totally blowing up how we work, I'm interested.

**[SALESLOFT REP]** That's exactly the goal. You don't want to overturn your entire sales process. You want to add visibility and structure so that the deals that are going to close are actually closing, and the ones that shouldn't are getting killed faster.

**[PATRICIA]** There's one more thing I want to ask about. You mentioned multi-threading earlier, and I know that's a big piece of this. But our AEs are not naturally comfortable with that. They build one deep relationship with a champion, and they're like, "That person gets it, I'm going with them." How do you get a team to multi-thread when their instinct is to go deep?

**[SALESLOFT REP]** That's a coaching and culture thing. But here's what we've seen work: if you make multi-threading visible in Salesloft—like, you can see "Account X has touches with four stakeholders vs. Account Y has touches with one"—and you put that in a leaderboard or talk about it in deals reviews, you change behavior. And then, if you adjust your compensation to reward pipeline health and forecast accuracy, not just closes, people adjust.

You might say, "Okay, for a deal over $500K, you need touches with at least three buying committee members before it can go to Closed Won." That sounds restrictive, but actually, it's going to prevent deals from falling apart after the champion leaves.

**[PATRICIA]** That's a bit of a cultural shift for us.

**[SALESLOFT REP]** It is. But the alternative is what you're dealing with now: champions leaving, deals stalling, competitors coming in from the side. The cost of that is way higher than the cost of changing how your team works.

**[PATRICIA]** Fair point. Okay, so what's the next step?

**[SALESLOFT REP]** I'd say: let's get your CRO on a call. I'll walk him or her through the product capabilities and the business case. We'll talk through a pilot structure. And if that feels right, we can get something in place for the first quarter.

**[PATRICIA]** I like that. Can you send me a summary of what we've talked about? And some of those customer references?

**[SALESLOFT REP]** Absolutely. I'll send over a one-pager on the business case, product capabilities, and pilot structure. And I'll get you intro emails to two of our customers who are similar to you. They've probably dealt with the same issues.

**[PATRICIA]** Great. I appreciate the time, Marcus. This was really helpful. And honest, which I appreciate.

**[SALESLOFT REP]** Thank you. I think you've got a great company and a great product. It's just a matter of making sure your sales engine matches the quality of what you're selling. I think we can help with that.

**[PATRICIA]** I hope so. Okay, let's talk soon.

**[SALESLOFT REP]** Sounds good. I'll send that follow-up over today. Thanks, Patricia.

## Key Takeaways

### Challenges Identified

1. **Bottom-Up Adoption Not Converting to Expansion**
   - Strong developer adoption (NPS 72) but no executive value narrative
   - Developers solve tactical problems, but procurement views as cost center
   - No formal expansion motion or business case building in early stages

2. **Champion Dependency & Deal Collapse**
   - Loss of VP Engineering on $2.2M financial services deal resulted in six-month extension
   - Weak multi-threading strategy; stakeholders limited to engineering/technical buyers
   - No budget-holder relationships = no deal resilience

3. **Multi-Year Deals & Cash Flow Constraints**
   - 8-12 month standard sales cycle; longest on record exceeded 14 months
   - 3-year commitment standard creates procurement friction
   - Board pressure for predictable revenue vs. sales team need for deal structure flexibility

4. **Technical Validation Extended Cycle**
   - 3+ months of technical validation typical for regulated/complex environments
   - Resource availability (customer IT teams) creates unpredictable delays
   - Testing vs. competing solutions (Boomi, MuleSoft) happens in parallel

5. **Competitive Displacement as Primary Risk**
   - Not losing to product; losing to sales process and competitive timing
   - Blind spot on when competitors engage (e.g., CIO encounters at conferences)
   - No coherent competitive positioning or battle card playbooks
   - Reactive vs. proactive competitive strategy

### Salesloft + Clari Value Proposition (Patricia's Take)

- **Real-time deal visibility**: Multi-threading visibility, stakeholder engagement signals, deal momentum tracking
- **Intent-based engagement**: Better timing for early-stage outreach (before competitor evaluation)
- **Process discipline**: Structured multi-threading requirements (e.g., 3+ buying committee members for deals >$500K)
- **Conservative ROI**: 5% improvement in AE quota attainment = $14M incremental revenue on $95M base; tool cost is $200-250K annually

### Next Steps

- CRO discussion to align on sales process transformation
- 90-day pilot with top 10 AEs or most complex deals
- Customer references from similar Platform-as-a-Service companies ($75M-110M ARR)
- Business case presentation to CFO for budget approval
