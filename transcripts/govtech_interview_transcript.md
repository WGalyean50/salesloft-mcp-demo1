## Opening & Context (0:00 - 2:15)

**Michael:** Joseph, thanks so much for making time today. We really appreciate it. For context, we're trying to understand how sales and revenue ops teams in the GovTech space are approaching their go-to-market strategy, especially around some of the unique dynamics in that sector. Before we dive into specifics, can you give us a quick overview of your current role and what the sales organization looks like at GovTech Solutions?

**Joseph:** Of course. I've been in this role for about three years now, and it's been a wild ride. We're at $150M ARR, which is still early-stage in the government space—plenty of room to grow. Our team is roughly 85 salespeople split between federal and state/local verticals. We've got a 35-person customer success team managing the renewals and upsells, and then revenue ops, demand gen—the full stack. It's definitely a different beast than commercial SaaS.

**Michael:** When you say different, what stands out to you most?

**Joseph:** Everything moves slower, but it's also more deliberate. The sales cycle is typically 9 to 18 months on the federal side, sometimes longer. State and local is a bit faster, maybe 6 to 12 months, but you're dealing with tighter budgets. And the gatekeeping is intense—you've got procurement, IT security, legal, multiple user groups who all get a vote. One person can't buy software in government; it's a committee sport.

**Michael:** That makes sense. Let's dig into some of the specific challenges that I know your team is wrestling with. Sarah and I were reviewing some data on GovTech companies, and FedRAMP certification kept coming up as a big bottleneck. How is that playing out for you guys?

---

## FedRAMP Certification & Competitive Positioning (2:15 - 12:40)

**Joseph:** [laughs] Oh man, FedRAMP. That's probably the biggest strategic question we're debating right now. So here's the situation: we achieved FedRAMP authorization about 18 months ago, which was a multi-year, multi-million dollar effort. We're talking $4-5M in direct costs—new cloud infrastructure, third-party assessments, documentation, the whole nine yards. Plus, it took 22 months of work with constant back-and-forth with the FedRAMP PMO.

**Sarah:** That's significant investment. Was that worth it from a competitive standpoint?

**Joseph:** Absolutely, no question. The ROI has been real. Before FedRAMP, we were completely locked out of any deals above a certain level with federal agencies. Once we got it, we immediately started winning larger opportunities. But here's the catch—and this is what keeps me up at night—the competitive landscape is shifting.

**Michael:** How so?

**Joseph:** When we got certified, it was still somewhat of a differentiator. Not many mid-market GovTech companies had it. Now? The bar has moved. Every serious competitor is either FedRAMP-authorized or they're in the middle of the authorization process. So it's become table stakes rather than a differentiator.

**Sarah:** So you're not seeing as much pull-through from the certification itself?

**Joseph:** We're still winning opportunities, but the closing velocity hasn't improved proportionally to the investment. What's happened is the certification bought us admission to the game, but it doesn't close deals on its own. You've got to have everything else right—the product, the team, the references, the security posture. The certification is necessary but not sufficient.

**Michael:** How are you thinking about this strategically going forward? Are there other certifications on the roadmap?

**Joseph:** That's the question. We're looking at CMMC 2.0 certification for defense contractors—that's another heavy lift, probably $2-3M and 18 months of work. We're also evaluating some of the newer frameworks. The calculus is always: "Who are our target customers? What do they actually require?" And then: "Can we get a better ROI on something else?"

**Sarah:** Do you see customers explicitly asking for CMMC, or is it more of a whisper in the background?

**Joseph:** It's becoming more explicit with defense contractors and their subs, but it's not universal yet. Here's what I'm thinking about instead: yes, we need certifications to stay competitive, but the real opportunity is in the business value, not the compliance credentials. We should be talking about how we help agencies do more with less budget, how we improve citizen outcomes, how we reduce operational friction. The FedRAMP certification is table stakes for federal work, but it's the outcomes that actually close deals.

**Joseph:** The other thing that's shifted is the timeline expectation. When we went through certification, agencies were hungry for modern solutions and willing to wait for the proof of authorization. Now, they're just expecting you to have it. And if you don't, you're out. So the competitive moat has actually narrowed, not widened.

**Michael:** That's a great insight. So if you're advising a company that's in that certification process right now, what would you tell them?

**Joseph:** I'd tell them: do it, but don't bet your entire go-to-market on it. Build the certification into your roadmap, but simultaneously build killer reference customers in the federal space who can open doors. The certification gets you in the meeting; your references and results win the deal. And think about the maintenance burden too—FedRAMP requires annual assessments, continuous monitoring, updating your package. It's not a one-time cost.

**Michael:** How much resource does the annual maintenance consume?

**Joseph:** We've got a dedicated team of three people, plus consulting support. I'd estimate $400-500K annually just to maintain our authorization. That's factored into our total cost of FedRAMP ownership.

---

## Contract Vehicles & Go-to-Market Constraints (12:40 - 20:30)

**Sarah:** That's really helpful context. Let's shift gears a bit. One thing that's come up in conversations with other GovTech leaders is the role of contract vehicles in shaping go-to-market strategy. We heard that you can't just sell directly in government; you often need to be on these vehicles. Can you walk us through how that works for you?

**Joseph:** Yeah, this is actually a bigger constraint on our growth than FedRAMP, to be honest. So in the federal space, agencies are required to follow federal procurement rules. Most of them buy through what are called GSA Schedule contracts or vehicles—which are essentially pre-negotiated agreements where the government agrees to buy from you at certain price points and terms.

**Michael:** How many vehicles are you on?

**Joseph:** We're on six major vehicles right now: GSA Schedule 84, two different IDIQ contracts for specific agencies, and three GSA Advantage vehicles. Getting on each one of those takes months and costs real money. There are application fees, documentation requirements, legal review. It's not trivial.

**Sarah:** And does being on a vehicle give you automatic access to deals, or do you still have to win them?

**Joseph:** Good question. It's necessary but not sufficient—sound familiar? [laughs] The vehicle gets your solution in the catalog, but agencies still have to go through their own procurement process. A lot of them use competitive quotation processes, even when you're on the vehicle. So it eliminates the barrier to entry, but you still have to win.

**Joseph:** Here's what's tricky: different agencies use different vehicles, and some agencies have preferences for certain vehicles. So if a critical target agency only accepts GSA Advantage, you have to be on that vehicle or you're shut out. We've definitely been in situations where we've lost deals because we weren't on the right vehicle.

**Michael:** Have you had to make a decision not to be on a certain vehicle?

**Joseph:** Actually, yes. We looked at joining a few government-wide IDIQ vehicles that are lower-revenue, and we decided the maintenance burden wasn't worth it. These vehicles require quarterly reporting, proposal responses, compliance certifications. For vehicles that generate less than $500K annually, it doesn't pencil out.

**Sarah:** Do you have dedicated people managing vehicles, or is it part of a broader function?

**Joseph:** We have one full-time contract vehicle manager who essentially manages our relationships with GSA and the vehicles, tracks compliance requirements, makes sure we're current on certifications. Then our sales team does the day-to-day selling. The vehicle manager is constantly identifying new vehicles, evaluating entry requirements, and tracking renewal dates.

**Joseph:** The other dynamic is partnerships. Because of the vehicle constraint, we've had to build relationships with larger integrators and contractors who have broader access. Some of them serve as resellers on certain vehicles or co-bid on larger opportunities. That's added complexity to our go-to-market model but opened up some opportunities we wouldn't otherwise have access to.

**Michael:** Are those partnerships working out? Any channels that are stronger than others?

**Joseph:** We have good relationships with three major integrators. Two of them are bringing us meaningful deals, maybe 15-20% of federal revenue. The third isn't as productive. The issue is that we have to share margin, and if the integrator doesn't have strong solution knowledge, the deal slows down. We're having to invest heavily in enablement for partners.

**Sarah:** From a forecasting perspective, how do you model these partnerships? Are they predictable?

**Joseph:** Not particularly, which is a pain point. Partnership deals have longer sales cycles because you've got two companies' interests to align. We've gotten better at it—we have quarterly business reviews with each partner, we set explicit targets. But there's definitely inherent unpredictability.

**Joseph:** Here's the bigger strategic question: we're stuck. Federal has the best margins and the longest retention, but the barriers to entry—FedRAMP, vehicles, partnerships—require significant investment and coordination. State and local doesn't have all these constraints, but the margins are lower, budgets are tighter, and decision-making is even more fragmented. So we're diversifying our portfolio, but we can't walk away from federal.

**Michael:** So federal is strategic, but it's not scalable in the traditional sense?

**Joseph:** Exactly. You can grow federal revenue, but you can't do it with a traditional, high-velocity go-to-market. It requires patience, relationship-building, and a willingness to customize. Our reps on the federal side have smaller pipelines but longer deal values. State and local reps have bigger pipelines but smaller deal sizes.

## Fiscal Year-End Dynamics & Pipeline Management (20:30 - 26:15)

**Michael:** That's super helpful. Let me ask about something else that's very specific to government sales: fiscal year-end dynamics. We talk to a lot of folks who say that government has a "feast or famine" dynamic where deals either come at the last minute in the fiscal year or stall until the next year. Is that something you see?

**Joseph:** Oh man, 100%. This is one of the most frustrating dynamics in government sales. So the federal fiscal year ends September 30th, and agencies have "use it or lose it" budgets. That means if they've got unused budget in their fiscal year, they either have to spend it before the deadline or lose it the next year. That creates this artificial urgency at the end of the fiscal year.

**Sarah:** How does that play out in your pipeline?

**Joseph:** So typically, from July through August, we see a surge in deals. Agencies suddenly want to buy things they've been contemplating. And not just software—they're buying hardware, services, whatever. They've got to spend the money. We've had deals that closed literally on September 29th because the agency HAD to spend the budget.

**Joseph:** The flip side is August 15th through September 30th is also when a lot of agencies shut down procurement for the fiscal year transition. So it's this narrow window where deals either accelerate or stop. And then October 1st rolls around and things reset.

**Michael:** How do you manage capacity for that? Do you bring on temporary resources?

**Joseph:** We try to. The challenge is you can't just hire contract salespeople to handle a 60-day surge. So we focus on forecasting, acceleration tactics, and trying to smooth the pipeline throughout the year. But it's impossible to completely eliminate.

**Joseph:** Actually, the bigger challenge is in the fall. October, November, December—agencies are in their new fiscal year and most of them have already allocated their budgets. So the pipeline goes quiet. Things pick back up in January, February. We actually try to do a lot of our pipeline building in those slow months, knowing that deals will accelerate later.

**Sarah:** From a revenue standpoint, does that create lumpy quarters? I'd imagine September and March could be really strong.

**Joseph:** It absolutely does. Our Q3 is always strong because of the September spend. But Q4 is typically weak because agencies are in budget-planning mode. And then Q1 is unpredictable because it depends on how many deals we seeded in the slow period. Revenue ops has to manage this carefully for accurate forecasting and cash flow planning.

**Michael:** Have you changed your incentive structure to account for this?

**Joseph:** We've experimented with it. Some of our federal reps are on accelerators that kick in for deals closed in the last 60 days of the fiscal year, which helps. But you still get some perverse incentives—reps might hold deals back until late in the fiscal year to hit accelerators. We've tried to balance it with deal quality metrics.

**Joseph:** The state and local dynamic is different. Different states have different fiscal years—California's is July to June, Texas is September to August, New York is April to March. So the seasonality is spread across the calendar. It's actually less predictable but more smoothed out. Federal gives you certainty on the timing but creates feast-or-famine; state and local is more consistent but harder to forecast.

**Michael:** That's an interesting segmentation insight. Are your reps' quotas structured differently by geography?

**Joseph:** They are. Federal reps have higher quotas but more variable compensation. State and local reps have lower quotas but more predictable commissions. It's a different risk profile.

## Budget Constraints & ROI Messaging (26:15 - 31:00)

**Sarah:** Let's talk about the budget piece. We know that state and local governments are facing real budget pressure, especially post-pandemic. How is that affecting your conversations and your value proposition?

**Joseph:** This is where the sales conversation is fundamentally different in government versus commercial. In commercial SaaS, you're typically selling to someone who wants to grow the business or improve efficiency. In government, you're selling to someone who's trying to maintain services with a shrinking or flat budget.

**Joseph:** So the ROI story has to be different. We can't just say, "This will help you grow." We have to say, "This will help you do more with less." And the "less" is real—municipalities and states are facing revenue shortfalls. Property tax collections are down in some places, sales tax is unpredictable, and the federal government is pushing costs down to the states through unfunded mandates.

**Michael:** How does that change your messaging?

**Joseph:** We focus heavily on cost avoidance and operational efficiency. How many FTEs can they eliminate by automating this process? How much faster can they process licenses or permits, which means faster revenue? For a municipal licensing department, if we can help them process permits 20% faster, that's real money—it's either reduced staffing needs or increased revenue.

**Joseph:** The other angle is federal funding pass-throughs. A lot of state programs receive federal grant money, and there are specific requirements about how they can spend it. We actually have products that help agencies track federal compliance and demonstrate ROI on federal funds, which makes it easier to get reapproved for next year's grant.

**Sarah:** That sounds like a competitive advantage.

**Joseph:** It is, but it's also something we have to actively sell. A lot of state procurement people don't think about the federal funding angle; they're just focused on cost. So we have to educate them, connect them with the right stakeholder in the organization who cares about federal compliance, and help them see the bigger picture.

**Joseph:** Here's the challenge: state and local budgets are so tight that even a $50K software investment is a big deal. That might be a rounding error in commercial SaaS, but for a state agency, that's real money. So we often end with smaller deal sizes than we'd like, but much stronger retention because the ROI is so visible.

**Michael:** Are you seeing any shift in federal funding that's trickling down to state and local?

**Joseph:** We're seeing a lot of uncertainty. There's been infrastructure funding through ARPA and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, but that money is time-limited and earmarked for specific uses. It's not going to sustain a long-term platform investment. States and municipalities are conscious that when that federal money runs out, they're going to have to fund it themselves.

**Joseph:** So we're actually being cautious about deals that are 100% funded by temporary federal grants. We want to make sure there's a path to sustainability once the grant runs out.

**Michael:** That's smart. Does that affect your ideal customer profile?

**Joseph:** It does. We're looking for agencies that have demonstrated budget stability, diverse revenue streams, and a track record of reinvesting in technology. Some municipalities are just better at managing their finances than others, and they're more likely to be long-term customers.

## Long Sales Cycles & Multi-Stakeholder Management (31:00 - End)

**Sarah:** Let's touch on one final piece, which is the complexity of managing these long sales cycles with so many stakeholders. You mentioned earlier that it's a committee sport. Can you walk us through what a typical federal sales cycle looks like from first conversation to close?

**Joseph:** [pauses] Sure, but there's honestly no "typical." They're all different. But let me give you a composite example. Say we're selling to a federal agency that needs a solution for, I don't know, case management. The user community—maybe 50 caseworkers spread across three regional offices—is desperate for a better tool. They've been advocating internally for a solution.

**Joseph:** Month 1-2: We're in discovery conversations with those users and their manager. They're excited, they're telling us their pain points, and they're encouraging us to move forward. So far so good.

**Joseph:** Month 3-4: The procurement team gets involved. They start asking questions about security, compliance, integration capabilities, cost. We're now spending time in calls with procurement people who weren't in the initial discovery. And their priorities are different from the users—they care about contract terms, liability, compliance, not necessarily product fit.

**Joseph:** Month 5-6: We're in parallel discussions with IT. They want to understand infrastructure requirements, security architecture, how it integrates with their existing systems. IT can kill a deal if they don't believe in the technical fit. And by the way, IT wasn't in the original user discovery conversation, so they're learning about the requirement for the first time.

**Joseph:** Month 7-8: Legal and Finance are weighing in. Legal cares about terms and conditions, data rights, accessibility. Finance is asking about pricing models, total cost of ownership, and whether this comes out of their budget or the user department's budget.

**Joseph:** Month 9-10: We finally get to a point where everyone has weighed in, there's a consensus that this is the right solution, and we're drafting a statement of work. But in those 9-10 months, the scope might have evolved, the budget might have changed, the users might have different requirements than they did at the beginning.

**Michael:** And that's assuming no roadblocks?

**Joseph:** Right. That's the happy path. In reality, there are delays. An IT person who was skeptical doesn't engage fully and slows things down. A procurement person asks for contract terms we can't accept and we have to negotiate. There's a leadership change and the new director wants to revisit the entire decision. We had one deal that we'd been working on for 11 months, thought we had a close, and then the agency had a budget reprioritization and the whole deal got pushed to the next fiscal year.

**Sarah:** How do you manage visibility through that? That's a really long timeline with a lot of moving parts.

**Joseph:** This is where tools matter. We use Salesforce for CRM, but we've had to build some custom workflows to manage federal deals. For a complex deal, we're tracking: the user community and their sentiment, procurement status, IT assessment status, legal review stage, finance approval stage. And we're managing parallel process streams rather than sequential.

**Joseph:** The key is not to wait for one group to finish before engaging the next. As soon as we know there's going to be a deal, we're simultaneously engaging procurement, IT, legal, and finance. We call it "parallel procurement." Instead of a linear approval process, we're running multiple tracks at once.

**Michael:** Does that work?

**Joseph:** It's more efficient than sequential, but it's complicated to manage. You've got to coordinate. You don't want IT to make a decision that conflicts with what procurement agreed to. And you need really strong account management to keep everything orchestrated.

**Joseph:** For our biggest deals, we have a deal team: account executive, solution architect, services leader, sometimes a finance analyst from our side. That team meets weekly to coordinate, figure out what the blockers are, identify what the next milestone is, and plan the next set of customer interactions.

**Sarah:** From a forecasting perspective, how confident are you in deals that are 6, 9, 12 months out?

**Joseph:** [laughs] Honestly, not very. Once we're past month 6, confidence drops significantly. Too much can change. Budget priorities shift, leadership changes, the user community's needs evolve, a competitor comes in with a lower price. We use different probability assumptions for federal deals based on the stage in the procurement cycle. A deal that just entered IT review has maybe 40% probability of closing even if we think it's a good fit, because there's so much that can go wrong.

**Michael:** What stage gives you the most confidence?

**Joseph:** Once legal and finance have signed off and we're drafting the statement of work, I'd say we're at 80% confidence. But even then, there's always a surprise. I've seen deals killed in the final week because someone in the user community had a concern that bubbled up.

**Joseph:** The other thing that helps with visibility is references. If we can bring in a customer who's using the product at another agency, that de-risks the decision. References are worth their weight in gold in government. A peer agency saying, "Yeah, we use this and we love it," is more persuasive than any demo we can do.

**Michael:** Do you have a formal references program?

**Joseph:** We do. We have maybe 20 reference customers across federal and state/local who we can call on. Managing that pool is important—you can't overuse them, they have to be genuinely willing to talk, and ideally they're in a similar vertical or agency type to the prospect. But yes, references are a critical part of the strategy.

**Joseph:** Here's what I wish I had better visibility into: which deals are truly progressing versus which ones are stalled. A deal can be in procurement for 4 months and look completely stuck, and then it accelerates suddenly because a budget came through. Another deal can look active and then get deprioritized. The volume and complexity make it hard to distinguish signal from noise.

**Sarah:** That's where predictive intelligence would help. If we could look at deal signals—engagement patterns, stakeholder involvement, pace of responses—and flag which deals are likely to progress versus which ones are stalled, that would change your management cadence.

**Joseph:** That would be incredibly valuable. We're managing 40-50 federal opportunities at any given time, and trying to keep track of all the stakeholders and their sentiment is like herding cats. If you had AI flagging which deals are warming up and which ones are going cold, that would fundamentally change how we manage the pipeline.

**Michael:** That's incredibly helpful, Joseph. I know we've covered a lot of ground. Before we wrap, are there any other challenges that are top of mind for your team?

**Joseph:** A few things. One is that a lot of our federal customers are consolidating vendors. They want one platform that does multiple things rather than best-of-breed point solutions. So we're having to expand our product roadmap to address more use cases and integrations. That's a product strategy question but it's driven by customer needs.

**Joseph:** Second, we're seeing increasing pressure from startups that are digital-first and going after specific niche use cases within government. They move fast, they're not bogged down by legacy, they're often cheaper. We have to make sure we're not losing deals to newer competitors who are more agile.

**Joseph:** And third, the talent piece. Building and retaining a sales team that understands government is hard. A lot of people come from commercial SaaS and they struggle with the longer cycles and the different success metrics. We've invested a lot in onboarding and training, but the turnover is real.

**Michael:** That's a great set of challenges. I think we could probably spend another hour on each of those. But thank you so much for being so generous with your time and insights. This has been really valuable.

**Joseph:** Happy to do it. You guys are asking good questions. Honestly, the GovTech space is evolving rapidly, and it's helpful to talk to vendors who understand the nuance. A lot of people parachute into government sales without understanding the dynamics, and they get frustrated. But if you understand the game and you're willing to play the long game, there's real opportunity here.

**Sarah:** We appreciate that. We'll definitely follow up as we build out solutions specifically for GovTech revenue teams. There's clearly a need for better pipeline visibility, forecasting, and deal management tools built specifically for this landscape.

**Joseph:** Please do. And if you want to continue the conversation or want to run a pilot with a subset of our team, I'm open to it.

**Michael:** That's great. We'll be in touch.

## Key Takeaways & Strategic Insights

### FedRAMP Certification
- **Investment Reality:** $4-5M over 22 months for authorization, plus $400-500K annually for maintenance
- **ROI Paradox:** Certification is now table stakes rather than a differentiator; necessary for federal but doesn't close deals independently
- **Strategic Implication:** Investment in certifications should be paired with aggressive reference customer development and business value storytelling
- **Competitive Shift:** As more competitors achieve certification, the competitive moat narrows; business outcomes matter more than credentials

### Contract Vehicles & Go-to-Market
- **Market Access Barrier:** Being on the right contract vehicles is necessary but not sufficient for deal closure
- **Resource Investment:** 1 FTE dedicated contract vehicle manager, plus quarterly compliance overhead
- **Partnership Dependency:** Integrators and resellers provide channel access but add margin requirements and complexity
- **Strategic Tension:** Federal offers higher margins but requires significant upfront investment; state/local is more accessible but lower-margin
- **Portfolio Diversification:** Revenue mix shifting to balance federal's long cycles with state/local's faster movement

### Fiscal Year-End Dynamics
- **Feast-or-Famine Pattern:** 60-day surge at end of federal fiscal year (July-September) followed by October-December slowdown
- **Capacity Challenge:** Cannot hire temporary resources to handle surge; must forecast and smooth pipeline year-round
- **Compensation Strategy:** Accelerators for late-fiscal-year deals help but create perverse incentives
- **State/Local Difference:** Distributed fiscal years reduce seasonality but increase forecasting unpredictability

### Budget Constraints & ROI Messaging
- **Value Proposition Shift:** Government buyers care about cost avoidance and efficiency, not growth
- **Deal Size Reality:** $50K is significant; ROI must be visible and quantifiable
- **Federal Funding Angle:** Grant compliance and reapproval pathways create additional value narratives
- **Customer Selection:** Preference for agencies with budget stability and multi-year technology commitment
- **Risk Profile:** Wary of deals 100% funded by temporary federal grants

### Long Sales Cycles & Multi-Stakeholder Management
- **Typical Timeline:** 9-12 months for federal deals with multiple concurrent stakeholder streams
- **Parallel Procurement:** Running simultaneous IT, procurement, legal, and finance reviews rather than sequential approval
- **Deal Team Model:** Account executive, solution architect, services leader, and finance analyst coordinating weekly
- **Confidence Levels:** 40% confidence at IT review stage; 80% once legal and finance sign off
- **Reference Program:** 20 reference customers critical to de-risking decisions; peer validation is more persuasive than demos
- **Visibility Gap:** Difficult to distinguish progressing deals from stalled ones; predictive signals would significantly improve pipeline management

### Organizational Implications
- **Sales Structure:** Federal reps with higher quotas/variable comp; state/local with lower quotas/stable comp
- **Pipeline Complexity:** 40-50 federal opportunities at various stages with minimal visibility into true momentum
- **Retention Risk:** Commercial SaaS talent struggles with longer cycles; onboarding and training critical
